# XYL Testnet

XYL Testnet is a blockchain network created for testing and development purposes, specifically designed to evaluate the functionality and features of the XYL ecosystem. This testnet is used to simulate transactions, mining, and other blockchain operations before the official release of XYL's mainnet.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **PoW Consensus**: Proof-of-Work consensus with fast processing times.
- **RPC Access**: EVM-compatible RPC interface, providing an easy connection for interacting with the blockchain (e.g., MetaMask).
- **Smart Contracts**: Custom smart contracts to enable decentralized applications (dApps).
- **Fast Block Times (2-5 seconds)**: Experience near-instant transaction processing and rapid block propagation with XYL's fast block times.
- **Simple and Secure**: XYL Testnet is designed to have a simple interface while maintaining the security and integrity of the network.
- **EVM-Compatible**: XYL supports Ethereum-style transactions and smart contracts, enabling developers to leverage existing Ethereum tools and libraries.

## 🧪 XYL Testnet Protocol

- **Block Time**: 2-5 seconds
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Proof-of-Work (PoW) with future plans for Proof-of-Stake (PoS)
- **Transaction Fees**: XYL's gas model ensures fair and efficient use of network resources and miner reward.
- **Network Speed**: Designed for high throughput with low latency.

## ❓ How to Interact with XYL Testnet

You can connect to it via MetaMask (or an EVM-compatible wallet) or interact with it directly through your Python environment.

### 🦊 MetaMask Setup

1. Open MetaMask and go to **Settings** > **Networks** > **Add Network**.
2. Enter the following details:

   - **New RPC URL**: `https://xyl-testnet.glitch.me/rpc/`
   - **Chain ID**: `6934`
   - **Currency Symbol**: XYL
3. Save and connect MetaMask to the XYL TestNet.

## 💡 Key Benefits for Developers

- **Test New Features Safely**: Test your projects on the XYL Testnet without the risk of spending actual money.
- **Faucets**: Get free test tokens to test your dApps or projects without spending actual valuable tokens.
- **Simple & Straightforward Contract Codes**: Contracts can be easily programmed with XYL's own instruction set.
- **Python support**: Interaction with the network is straightforward for developers due to python libraries programmed exclusively for making interaction with the XYL ecosystem easier.

## 🛣 Roadmap

- **Mainnet (Coming Soon)**: The XYL Testnet will serve as the foundation for the upcoming XYL mainnet. Stay tuned for the official launch.
